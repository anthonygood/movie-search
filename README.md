## Movie-search

A simple React application for searching The Movie Database.


### Installation and setup

The app needs a valid `API_KEY` for The Movie Database -- you can declare one in a .dotenv file.

```
touch .env
echo "API_KEY=yourkey" >> .env
```

With your `.env` file in place, you can install and run a server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

A dev server will be started at `localhost:8080`.

### Run tests
```
npm test
```
