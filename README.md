## Movie-search

A simple React application for searching The Movie Database.

It needs to be a valid `API_KEY` for The Movie Database -- you can declare one in a .dotenv file.

```
touch .env
echo "API_KEY=yourkey" >> .env
```

### Installation and setup

```
npm install
npm start
```

A dev server will be started at `localhost:8080`.
